# Interface: Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)

Any model that wants to be simulated by means of DQMC must implement the following interface. Below you find all semantic definitions and precise signatures of mandatory fields and mandatory and optional methods that any model should implement to work with the determinant Monte Carlo flavor [Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)](@ref).

Example models: [Attractive Hubbard Model](@ref)

## Mandatory fields

 * `flv::Int`: number of distinct fermion flavors (e.g. spins, bands, etc.). The Green's function will have shape `(flv*N, flv*N)`, where `N` is the number of sites. Note that different fermion flavors are often related by symmetry and it's advisable to use this symmetry to work with smaller Green's function matrices. Have a look at the [Attractive Hubbard Model](@ref) as an example where `flv=1` although it has spinful fermions.
